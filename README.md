Wookie is an asynchronous HTTP server written in common lisp. It is in beta at
the moment. Wookie is named after my dog who is extremely tempermental, 
image-conscious, and makes sounds like a wookie when you squeeze him. He views
himself as royalty, and we are all forever in his debt for his invaluable gift
of existing on the same planet as us. This project is dedicated to him.

Originally, the goal was to port Hunchentoot to async, but Wookie took a
divergent turn and is now its own project.

Wookie requires git versions of: [cl-libevent2](/orthecreedence/cl-libevent2),
[cl-async](/orthecreedence/cl-async), [http-parse](/orthecreedence/http-parse)

Documentation
-------------
Wookie's documentation lives on [the Wookie website](http://orthecreedence.github.com/wookie).
It's a work in progress, but should take shape at a steady pace.

License
-------
Wookie is MIT licensed, but only under the terms that you swear unconditional
compliance and servitude to the dog, Wookie, and accept him as your king.
